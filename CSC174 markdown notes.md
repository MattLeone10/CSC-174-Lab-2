### comments on kwong25 website

* Color scheme comments
  * background photo + white font coloring is pleasant
* Functionality comments
  * Menu bar moves to top right when clicking into "subpages", slightly unintuitive (nitpick)
  * on sub pages footer is not at the bottom of page
* Layout 
  * I like the layout, it makes sense. Only thing is potentially the movement of the menu bar
  * Maybe need an arrow to indicate content on bottom of homepage... Offchance that someone doesn't know there is more

### comments on mprice21 website 

* Color scheme comments
  * Agree that the red contrasts too heavily
  * The colors are nice, don't know the excessive white space
  * ~~See what the windy city has to offer banner text should be centered. The last two words __"to offer"__ are on the left part of its container, and look odd.~~
  * ~~removed underline to avoid confusion with hyperlink~~
  * ~~reduced margin around .visit figures, too much white space~~
* Layout
  * The elements of the website take up a little too much vertical space and not enough horizontal space in my opinion
* Visuals
  * The photos on the main page should be smaller, in my opinion they are too large. Maybe we can make the pictures smaller and reformat the layout of them. We have these really large photos that take up a lot of space and are very bright and colorful

### comments on mleone10 website 

* Color scheme comments
  * I like the background color, maybe we can add some more colors that compliment this
* Layout
  * Want to center the ridgewood nj heading, photos and the title of the sub pages
* visual embellishments
  * maybe add in some more colors, flourishes, etc. to make the pages more exciting
